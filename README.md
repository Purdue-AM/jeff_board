# jeff_boardV2
A straightforward Arduino Nano breakout board that allows for driving 2 PWM lines up to 30V, powered on 12/24V, and connects to two thermal sensors. 

V2 is a revision of the original jeff Board to have 4 total 24V PWM lines, which will allow controlling UV LEDs, another heater, or another fan. There's plenty of space to add a step-down to 12V if one already has 12V UV LEDs.
